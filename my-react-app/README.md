# My Portfolio

## Want to use this template?

I will release this template in a new repository soon with a walkthrough for those who need complete directives.

The react template used was a Vite template that you can setup with the following npm script:
`npm create vite@latest my-react-app --template react`

## Cloning for this first time

As with most node projects, after cloning, install dependencies with the following command: 

` npm install `

If you want to run it locally with Vite, the page will open at http://localhost:5173/ when you run the following command: 

`npm run dev`

## Dependencies

Check the package.json for a complete list.

Essentials :

### For React :

`npm i react react-dom react-icons `


### For Vite :
`npm i vite `
